Dear Reader,

This is an web-app to recreate snake game of 3310 mobile phone. The idea is to:
a) Create a grid of divs, i.e. 10x10 grid. This means 100 divs in the .grid div or 100 squares.
b) The squares that represent the snake of the apple, are drawn respectively.
c) Rules, control and results are implemented in our .js application file(myapp.js).

Feel free to comment/suggest improvements :)
