Dear Reader,
<br /><br />
This is an web-app to recreate snake game of 3310 mobile phone. The idea is to:<br />
a) Create a grid of divs, i.e. 10x10 grid. This means 100 divs in the .grid div or 100 squares.<br />
b) The squares that represent the snake of the apple, are drawn respectively.<br />
c) Rules, control and results are implemented in our .js application file(myapp.js).<br />
<br /><br />
Feel free to comment/suggest improvements :)<br /><br />
